Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> ID ASSIGN type
Rule 2     type -> TYPE
Rule 3     type -> TYPE LSQUARE RSQUARE
Rule 4     expression -> expression COMMA expression
Rule 5     expression -> LBRACE expression RBRACE

Terminals, with rules where they appear

ASSIGN               : 1
COMMA                : 4
ID                   : 1
LBRACE               : 5
LSQUARE              : 3
RBRACE               : 5
RSQUARE              : 3
TYPE                 : 2 3
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear
